We are pleased to share an important update from Loyalist College regarding the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) eligibility for college programs. On October 4th, the  IRCC released significant changes that emphasize field of study requirements for PGWP qualification.

To qualify for a PGWP, students must now complete a program associated with occupations experiencing long-term shortages. These academic fields are categorized into five key groups:

* Agriculture and Agri-food 
* Healthcare
* Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
* Trades
* Transportation

These changes will take effect on November 1, 2024. However, any study permit applications submitted to the IRCC before this date will still make students eligible for the PGWP, regardless of their field of study.

Loyalist College is diligently reviewing these new guidelines and will soon provide more detailed information regarding program eligibility and availability for the Winter, Spring, and Fall 2025 sessions.

We trust that this update will offer valuable clarity for prospective students and their families. As always, we are here to support you.
