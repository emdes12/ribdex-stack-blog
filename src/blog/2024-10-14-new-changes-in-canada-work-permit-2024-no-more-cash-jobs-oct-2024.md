### Key Changes in Work Permit Rules

***Stopping Cash Jobs***

Cash jobs have been a persistent issue in Canada, where workers are paid in cash to avoid taxes and regulations. These jobs are illegal and come with severe consequences for both employers and employees.

1. **Enforcement Actions**: Authorities have increased their efforts to crack down on illegal cash jobs. This includes conducting raids and inspections across the country.

2. **Strict Compliance:** Applicants must now adhere to stricter compliance measures to ensure their work permits are valid and lawful. 

***Restrictions on Flag Poling***

Flag poling is a practice where individuals leave and re-enter Canada to quickly obtain a work permit. This method has now been restricted.

***Legal Work Only***

Working legally in Canada is crucial for avoiding legal issues and ensuring job security.

1. **Documented Work**: Make sure your job is properly documented and you are paying taxes.
2. **Building a Good Record**: Working legally helps build a good work record, which is important for future job opportunities and immigration processes.

### Changes in LMIA and Work Permits
