## **History of Airlines in Nigeria**

### **1. Colonial Period**

The first airline services in Nigeria were established by Imperial Airways (later BOAC) in the 1930s, mainly to connect Nigeria with Britain and other parts of the British Empire.

### **2. Post-Independence Expansion**

Following Nigeria's independence in 1960, the country sought to develop its own airlines. Nigerian Airways, the national carrier, was established in 1958, providing both domestic and international services.

### **3. 1970s–1980s**

The Nigerian government's "Nigeria Air Policy" led to the rise of domestic carriers such as Okada Air, Kabo Air, and ADC Airlines. However, Nigeria Airways faced financial issues, which contributed to its decline.

### **4. 1990s: Privatization**

Due to financial problems, Nigeria Airways was privatized in the mid-1990s and eventually liquidated in 2003. Private airlines like Arik Air, Dana Air, and Air Peace emerged, boosting competition and growth.

### **5. 2000s–2010s**

Despite safety and regulatory challenges, airlines such as Arik Air and Air Peace expanded both domestically and internationally.

### **6. Recent Developments**

In 2016, Nigeria signed a Bilateral Air Services Agreement with the UAE, leading to increased flights between the two nations. Efforts to launch Nigeria Air as the national carrier are ongoing.
