**Ribdex Global to Take Over Visa Services in 26 New Countries: Streamlining the Process for International Travelers**

In a significant move to enhance visa application services, Ribdex Global is set to take over visa services from TLScontact in 26 new countries across Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. This transition, which started in September 2024 and will continue until January 2025, is designed to improve the overall experience for visa applicants in these regions.

**Countries Affected by the Change**
Ribdex Global, a trusted provider specializing in visa outsourcing and technology services, will replace TLScontact as the operator of Visa Application Centers (VACs) in the affected countries. Notably, regions outside of Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia will not be impacted by this transition.

**Phase 1: Starting from October 22, 2024**, Ribdex Global will begin operating VACs in the following countries:

- Algeria
- Côte d’Ivoire
- Democratic Republic of Congo
- Gabon
- Gambia
- Ghana
- Kenya
- Madagascar
- Mauritius
- Morocco
- Seychelles
- South Africa
- Tunisia

**Phase 2: Additionally, from November 5, 2024**, Ribdex Global will operate VACs in:

- Cyprus (North)
- France
- Iraq
- Israel
- Jordan
- Kazakhstan
- Kyrgyzstan
- Lebanon
- Occupied Palestinian Territories
- Tajikistan
- Turkey
- Ukraine
- Uzbekistan

The UK government has already shifted the visa application center in Belgium, which is now managed by Ribdex Global.

This switch is part of a broader effort to increase the accessibility and efficiency of visa services for international travelers.

**Ribdex Global’s Role**
As the new commercial partner, Ribdex Global will manage Visa Application Centers (VACs) in the specified countries. These centers will offer services such as visa application acceptance, biometric collection, and passport return.

**Impact on Visa Applicants**
For applicants in these 26 countries, the transition to Ribdex Global means new procedures. However, UK authorities have reassured that this change will not affect the outcome of applications or the processing time.

**Key Points for Applicants**

1. **Appointment Bookings**
   If you have already booked an appointment with a TLScontact-managed center, you should attend it as planned. Double-check the address provided in your confirmation email to avoid any confusion.

2. **Mandatory User Pay (MUP) Fee**
   If you need to change your appointment during the transition, you may be required to pay the MUP fee again. Contact TLScontact for a refund if you are charged twice.

3. **No Impact on Visa Decisions**
   The UK government has emphasized that this change in service providers will not affect the processing time or decision-making process for visa applications.

**What This Means for Visa Services**
With Ribdex Global's experience and resources, visa applicants in the affected countries can expect more streamlined and user-friendly processes. This shift will likely improve access to services, including better customer support, online tools, and flexible appointment options.

**Changes to Visa and Citizenship Services Inside the UK**
As of October 15, 2024, the UK Visa and Citizenship Application Services (UKVCAS) provider has transitioned from Sopra Steria to TLScontact. While this may temporarily affect appointment availability, there is no need for immediate action from applicants.

**Final Thoughts**
As Ribdex Global takes over visa services in these 26 countries, applicants should closely monitor emails for updates. The transition will not impact visa decisions or processing times, ensuring a smooth application experience with updated procedures.
