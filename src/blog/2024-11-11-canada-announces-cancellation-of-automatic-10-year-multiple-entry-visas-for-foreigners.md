**Canada Ends 10-Year Multiple-Entry Visa for Nigerians and Other Nationals**

The Canadian government has announced it will no longer issue 10-year multiple-entry visas for Nigerian citizens and others. This policy change comes as part of Canada’s effort to control immigration after a significant population increase post-COVID.

Previously, the multiple-entry visa allowed holders to freely enter and exit Canada over a 10-year period. However, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) clarified that such visas are no longer the “standard document” for international travelers. Updated guidelines now state that these extended-validity visas are no longer the default.

In its statement, IRCC highlighted that immigration officers now have greater discretion in issuing either single-entry or multiple-entry visas, with varying validity periods.

In a related update, IRCC also revised its permanent residency targets. In October, it reduced its 2025 goal from 500,000 to 395,000 new residents. For 2026, the target will drop further to 380,000, with an expected 365,000 new permanent residents in 2027.
